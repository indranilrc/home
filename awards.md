# Honors and Awards

## Individual Awards

* Senior Member, IEEE - 2015. IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization with more than 423,000 members in over 160 countries. In 2015, I was elevated to a Senior Member Grade of the IEEE based on my experience in the practice of prognostics and health management. The Senior Member grade of IEEE is the highest level of recognition that a professional member can directly apply for, and only 10% of the over 400,000 members of IEEE have been awarded this distinction. To be elevated to a Senior Member, applicants must be in professional practice for at least 10 years, and demonstrate significant performance over a period of at least five of those ten years in a field relevant to the IEEE, such as prognostics and health management. In addition, applicants must also provide three letters of recommendation from current IEEE members holding the grade of Senior, Fellow, or Honorary Member.
